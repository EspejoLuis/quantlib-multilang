# 20 July 2025 - Day One: setting environements and structure folder

- Setting Environments:
    - Quantlib 1-38 already installed in the past so we are good. It was a lengthy and somehow complex process but got it working.

-  Using ChatGpt to help me with suggestiongs about structure of folders. We can have one single repo and three folders. One for each language. Then later if needed we can extract folders:
    - Python folder --> python (uv and ruff)
    - C# folder--> csharp
    - c++ folder --> cpp
